Sure! Here’s a detailed prompt you can use to generate a Veo 3 video with sound and Albanian text-to-speech (TTS), set in a coffee shop (bar), where the bar owner walks in and greets everyone:

⸻

Prompt (for Veo 3):
Generate a cinematic video scene with natural ambient sound in a cozy Albanian-style coffee shop (bar). It’s morning, and the coffee shop is filled with regular customers sitting at tables, drinking espresso and chatting. The owner of the bar walks inside confidently. He is in his late 30s, wearing casual yet stylish clothes, and has a friendly presence. As he walks through the bar, he greets every customer warmly by saying “Hee, respekt!” using Albanian TTS with a friendly, energetic male voice. Each time he says it, he nods or gestures respectfully toward the person. Background sound should include quiet conversations, cups clinking, and a soft Albanian music playing in the background. The camera follows him from behind as he moves through the space, interacting with people.

Language: Albanian
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Yes, male voice saying: “Hee, respekt!” repeatedly, naturally timed
Setting: Albanian coffee shop/bar interior
Atmosphere: Warm, welcoming, everyday local vibe
Length: ~30–60 seconds
